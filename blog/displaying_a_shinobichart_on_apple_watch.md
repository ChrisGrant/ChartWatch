[The WatchKit programming guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/DesigningaWatchKitApp.html "WatchKit Programming Guide") states that 'If your iOS app and WatchKit extension rely on the same data, use a shared app group to store that data. An app group is an area in the local file system that both the extension and app can access.'
